The Hotel Table Reservation Software project is designed to make managing restaurant reservations in hotels easier and more efficient. It allows guests to book tables online and provides real-time updates on table availability. The software integrates with the hotelâ€™s existing system, helping to keep operations smooth and organized. Key features include automated reminders to reduce no-shows, easy-to-use booking tools, and detailed reports on dining trends. This helps hotel staff manage reservations better, optimize table usage, and improve guest satisfaction. With a user-friendly interface, the software enhances the dining experience for both guests and hotel staff.
